# machine_learning_from_scratch
Implementing popular machine learning algorithms from scratch

Currently only supports Deep (n-layer) Nerual Network models.

To-do:
1. convert optimizers to object-oriented
2. add train convergence tests (early stopping, best-weights, etc..)
3. add support for 2D convolutional layers and pooling layers
4. more model types (Mixture Density Network, etc..)?
