# machine_learning_from_scratch
Implementing popular machine learning algorithms from scratch

Currently only supports Deep (n-layer) Nerual Network models.

To-do:
1. convert optimizers to object-oriented
2. add support for 2D convolutional layers and pooling layers
3. more model types (Mixture Density Network, etc..)?
